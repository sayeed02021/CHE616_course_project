# CHE616_course_project
This repository consists the codes and data for our CHE616 Course Project.

The project involves simulating and analysing the flow of a granular mixture with particles with 2 different diameters when they flow down a long inclined chute. 

We compare the results with [Wiederseiner et al.](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/23/1/013301/985482), which conducts the segregation experiments using actual granular particles, although the feeder setup differs from our feeder setup. 

My project partner, Rohan Virmani, and I conducted the simulations and analysis under the guidance of our course instructor, Dr. Anurag Tripathi and course TA Rishabh Pal.
