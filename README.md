# CHE616_course_project
This repository consists the codes and data for our CHE616 Course Project.

The project involves simulating and analysing the flow of a granular mixture with particles with 2 different diameters when they flow down a long inclined chute. 

We compare the results with [Wiederseiner et al.](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/23/1/013301/985482), which conducts the segregation experiments using actual granular particles, although the feeder setup differs from our feeder setup. 

The simulations were carried out by me and my project partner Rohan Virmani, under the guidance of our course instructor Dr. Anurag Tripathi.
